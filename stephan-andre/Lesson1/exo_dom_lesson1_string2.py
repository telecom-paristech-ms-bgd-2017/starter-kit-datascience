# Additional basic string exercises

# D. verbing
# Given a string, if its length is at least 3,
# add 'ing' to its end.
# Unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case
# add 'ly' instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Return the resulting string.

def verbings(s):
    if len(s)>=3:
        if s[-2:] not in 'ing':
            s=s+'ing'
        else:
            s=s+'ly'
    else:
        s=s
    return s


# E. not_bad
# Given a string, find the first appearance of the
# substring 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows
# the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring
# with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# So 'This dinner is not that bad!' yields:
# This dinner is good!

def not_bad(s):
    a=s.find('not')
    b=s.find('bad')        
    if 'not' and 'bad' in s and b>a:
        s=s.replace(s[a:b+3],'good')
    else:
        s=s
    return s


# F. front_back
# Consider dividing a string into two halves.
# If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.
# If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half.
# e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form
#  a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back
#def front_back(a, b):
  # +++your code here+++
#  return

# Simple provided test() function used in main() to print
# what each function returns vs. what it's supposed to return.

  if got == expected:
    prefix = ' OK '
  else:
    prefix = '  X '
  print ('%s got: %s expected: %s' % (prefix, repr(got), repr(expected)))


# main() calls the above functions with interesting inputs,
# using the above test() to check if the result is correct or not.
